Math-Question-Generator
=======================

Uses Python to Automatically Generate PDF Question and Answer Sheets for K-12 math.

This program was developed on Ubuntu Precise with Python 2.7, TKinter, Latex and pdflatex.

Other Linux systems may require some tweaking for this program to work. 
Other Operating Sysytems will require major adjustments - perhaps wx-widgets is a place to start here.
